                        <p>There are millions of species of animals, and there are about 800,000 species of animals that have not been identified. Most of them live in the seas, and some in freshwater. As for the land, it contains the least number of different types of animals.</p>
                        <p>Animals vary in size, as there are very small animals whose bodies contain a few cells, and some weigh many tons, such as the white shark.</p>
                        <p>And if we add the real answer to the question posed; it is created for the leather and fur industries, food production, transportation, work, and the pharmaceutical industries, and for its importance in the environmental balance.</p>

                        <p>It is a state of balance between the upper and lower masses of the Earth's crust, such as the balance between humans and plants, in addition to animals and their environment. Photosynthesis contributes to creating an environment that stabilizes coexistence among all living organisms.</p>

                        <p>We also know that animals feed on plants, so their seeds pass through the digestive tracts without digestion, but changes occur in them that prepare them for germination, so animals transport them during their travel and they germinate in different places. Carnivores preserve by preying on herbivores, as eating more of them leads to their extinction. Likewise, insectivores maintain a balance between the numbers of the rest.</p>

                        <p>Yellowstone Park experienced a state of devastation, after the wolves were eliminated by residents and other hunters, and their death left the opportunity for “elk”, a species similar to deer, to spread widely, which resulted in the disappearance of grass, because it is their basic food, and the park no longer attracted birds.</p>
